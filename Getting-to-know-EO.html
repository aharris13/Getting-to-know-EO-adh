		<h2 id="center" style="background-color:white;">Introduction</h2>
			<p id="p">
				My name is Aaliyah Harris and I am from the Home-wood flossmoor area.

				I attended Homewood-flossmoor High School and then went on to puruse a

				nursing degree at The University of Missouri Columbia. It was a great school, yet

				It was entirely too large for myself. I then decided to move back home and 

				transfer to Lewis University-the best decision that I've made for myself

		<h2 id="center" style="background-color:white;">My major</h2>
		<h3 id="center"><i>Physics</i></h3>
			<p id="p" >I am curently a physics major with a concentration in advanced physics.
				I initially was not at interested in physics until I grew interested in 

				<strong>Astronomy.</strong> Galaxies, black holes, and neutron stars were the things that

				caught my eye. But once I began studying what each of those celestial bodies
		
				were made of, my curiosity of what was in the universe grew even more.

				I learned that the big things listed previously were made up of small things

				and many other factors-such as forces. I literally did not like physics

				until I was able to apply it to astronomy.

			<p id="p">My favortie hobby is watching youtube videos such as travel vlogs, TedTalks. and documentaries.
